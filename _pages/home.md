Welcome to the Natural Language Processing (NLP) Group @ USTC, which is led by [Zhen-Hua Ling](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~zhling/#!index.md) and is part of the [National Engineering Research Center for Speech and Language Information Processing](http://nelslip.ustc.edu.cn/) at the [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/). <br />

The USTC NLP Group studies the theoretical foundation and practical algorithms for language technologies. We tackle challenging learning and reasoning problems under uncertainty, and pursue answers via studies of machine learning, deep learning, and interdisciplinary data science. <br />

Broadly, we are interested in designing scalable inference and learning algorithms to analyze massive datasets with complex structures. In particular, our group concentrates in the areas of neural network based semantic represntation and reasoning, factoid question answering using knowledge base, dialogue systems, information extraction, and semantic representation in brain activity. <br />
